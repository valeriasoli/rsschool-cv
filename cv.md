>***I will tell your about myself. And why i went to RSSchool?***
>>In 2015 I entered the university, majoring in "Automated information processing systems", but after 2.5 years I wrote an application and left, now I regret it. For this reason, I decided not to think, but to try again, but a different version of programming. I think I can do it.

>***Basic level C and C++***

>***Secondary education. I completed 2 courses at the Belarusian-Russian University (BRU) in Mogilev.***

>***Basic level of English***
